# Welcome to Motion Trivia!

Using OpenCV, this game allows you to choose True or False for each trivia question by moving your head to the correct side of the screen! 
As of now, the questions come from a wide range of topics testing all sorts of knowledge, but I plan to add the ability to choose your
question category.

Through this project, I learned a lot about OpenCV, Python's threading module, and implementing an API in the context of a game. There were
many challenges along the way, but taking them on one at a time has greatly strengthened my problem-solving skills.

Thank you for checking out my game!
